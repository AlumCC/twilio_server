## Goals
This is a simple TwiML server to act as a JSON REST relay for Twilio. It supports single MMS attachments and can also be used as an endpoint for multiple Twilio numbers at once. It implments an extensible Flask-Restful architecture that allows easy modification to suit your needs.

## Installation
Install python 2.7.x and SQLite, then run the following

     git clone https://github.com/MikeRixWolfe/twilio_server.git
     sudo pip2 install -r requirements.txt

## Setup
Rename `app.cfg.default` to `app.cfg` and enter desired information, and run `python db_setup.py`.

## Usage
#### Server
Run `sudo python run.py` in a screen/tmux session or with nohup.
#### Client
Enter `http://yoursite.tld/twilioendpoint` as the TwiML endpoint for your Twilio number's messages to have the messages sent to the server.

Browse/cUrl/whatever `http://yoursite.tld/messages/<account_sid>` to retreive messages for that account.
