## Goals
This is a simple TwiML server to act as a JSON REST relay for Twilio. It supports single MMS attachments and can also be used as an endpoint for multiple Twilio accounts/numbers at once. It implments an extensible Flask-Restful architecture that allows easy modification to suit your needs; for example, publishing to Redis rather than writing to a SQLite database to implement a pub/sub architecture for use with other applications.

## Installation
Install python 2.7.x and SQLite, then run the following

     git clone https://github.com/MikeRixWolfe/twilio_server.git
     sudo pip2 install -r requirements.txt

## Setup
Rename `app.cfg.default` to `app.cfg` and enter desired information, and run `python db_setup.py`.

## Usage
#### Server
Run `wsgi.py` or use the included `.ini` and `.service` files to run the site under systemd.
#### Client
Enter `http://yoursite.tld/twilioendpoint` as the TwiML endpoint for your Twilio number's messages to have the messages sent to the server.

Browse/cUrl/whatever `http://yoursite.tld/messages/<account_sid>/<phone_number>` to retreive messages for that Twilio account and number.
